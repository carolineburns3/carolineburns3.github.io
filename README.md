# Introduction: Public Education in the US
The data set being used was found on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project

Public education across the United States is largely controlled by local and state governments. Revenue for schools varies across states and localities. For example, in 2017-18, 35 percent of Pennsylvania's revenue came from the state government and 60 percent from local property taxes (Department of Education). This is a similar trend across states, with some states with more state revenue than local.
