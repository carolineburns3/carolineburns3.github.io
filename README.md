# Introduction: Public Education in the US
The data set being used was found on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project

Public education across the United States is largely controlled by local and state governments. Revenue for schools varies across states and localities. For example, in 2017-18, 35 percent of Pennsylvania's revenue came from the state government and 60 percent from local property taxes (Department of Education). This is a similar trend across states, with some states having more state revenue than local. 

We are looking to explore how public school revenue and expenditure impacts learning outcomes, specifically math and reading standarized test scores. Using the data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project) we are able to explore this across states and time. []
